## Authentication service

``` bash
[ Client (Frontend) ]
         |
       NGINX
      /     \
[ Auth Service ]   <-- handles /login, /register, /verify, /refresh
[ Broker Service ] <-- receives commands, pushes to Redis/RabbitMQ
         |
    [ Other Services ]
       (mail, user, order, etc.)
```



‚úÖ Authentication Flow (Best Practice)
``` bash
[ UI / Frontend ]
     ‚Üì
POST /auth-service/login
Body: { mailAddress, password }

     ‚Üì
[ Authentication Service ]
- Looks up user by mailAddress in authentication-db
- Verifies password (bcrypt check)
- If valid:
    - Creates JWT (signed with shared secret or private key)
    - JWT includes: { user_id, role, mail, exp }
    - Returns: { success: true, token: <JWT>, user: { role, mail, ... } }

     ‚Üì
[ UI stores JWT securely ]
- localStorage or secure HttpOnly cookie
- Adds JWT to every future request as:
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

```

### üßë‚Äçüíº Example Use Cases

| Role                | Permissions                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Admin`             | Full access: manage users, system settings, view/edit all data               |
| `Sales Representative` | Access customer info, update leads/orders, generate sales reports            |
| `Customer`          | View own profile/orders, update account settings, limited access to features |


## üîê Call with JWT Token?

Some endpoints in the authentication service **require a valid JWT token** to ensure that the caller is authenticated and authorized. Whether you need to send a token depends on the **endpoint's access level** and **user role**.

### ‚úÖ Endpoints that **require** JWT Token

| Endpoint                        | Method | Role Required | Description                              |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| `/auth/logout`                 | POST   | Any Logged-in  | Invalidate a session                     |
| `/auth/refresh-jwt-token`     | POST   | Any Logged-in  | Refresh JWT token                        |
| `/auth/change-password`       | POST   | Any Logged-in  | Change password                          |
| `/auth/deactivate-user`       | POST   | Admin only     | Deactivate user account                  |
| `/auth/reactivate-user`       | POST   | Admin only     | Reactivate a user account                |
| `/auth/update-user`           | PUT    | Admin or User  | Update user info                         |
| `/auth/delete-user`           | DELETE | Admin only     | Permanently delete a user                |

**Send the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:**

```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
