## Authentication service

``` bash
[ Client (Frontend) ]
         |
       NGINX
      /     \
[ Auth Service ]   <-- handles /login, /register, /verify, /refresh
[ Broker Service ] <-- receives commands, pushes to Redis/RabbitMQ
         |
    [ Other Services ]
       (mail, user, order, etc.)
```



✅ Authentication Flow (Best Practice)
``` bash
[ UI / Frontend ]
     ↓
POST /auth-service/login
Body: { mailAddress, password }

     ↓
[ Authentication Service ]
- Looks up user by mailAddress in authentication-db
- Verifies password (bcrypt check)
- If valid:
    - Creates JWT (signed with shared secret or private key)
    - JWT includes: { user_id, role, mail, exp }
    - Returns: { success: true, token: <JWT>, user: { role, mail, ... } }

     ↓
[ UI stores JWT securely ]
- localStorage or secure HttpOnly cookie
- Adds JWT to every future request as:
  Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

```
